# RFC 2217 server (TCP to COM port redirector)
--------------------------------------------

You have a server computer with physical COM7 port and you'd like to share it
through the network by the RFC 2217 (Telnet Com Port Control Option) protocol:

 Start the [com2tcp-rfc2217.bat](https://com0com.sourceforge.net/hub4com/ReadMe.txt) on COM7 port. For example:

- `com2tcp-rfc2217.bat COM7 7000` for LAN mode without encryption
 ### or set physical serial port to COM7
 
- `ngrok4com -7`  for LAN mode without encryption
- `ngrok4com 7` for ngrok mode with encryption

It will listen TCP/IP port 7000 for incaming connections and
redirect them to COM7 port.

### or select physical serial port

- `ngrok4com -0` for LAN mode without encryption
- `ngrok4com` for ngrok mode with encryption

It will listen TCP/IP port 7000 for incaming connections and
redirect them to selected physical serial port.

### or select physical serial port and set TCP/IP port to 8000

- `ngrok4com -0 8000` for LAN mode without encryption
- `ngrok4com 0 8000` for ngrok mode with encryption

It will listen TCP/IP port 8000 for incaming connections and
redirect them to selected physical serial port.

# RFC 2217 client (COM port to TCP redirector)
--------------------------------------------

You have a server computer 192.168.1.1 with physical serial port
shared through the network by the RFC 2217 protocol (see above example) and
you'd like to use it on the client computer like a virtual serial port.

With the com0com's Setup Command Prompt create COM11<->CNCB0 virtual
COM port pair (see com0com's [ReadMe.txt](com0com.md) for more info). For example:
     
- `setupc install 0 PortName=COM#,RealPortName=COM11,EmuBR=yes,AddRTTO=10,AddRITO=10 -`

  Start the com2tcp-rfc2217.bat on CNCB0 port. For example:
  
- `com2tcp-rfc2217.bat \\.\CNCB0 192.168.1.1 7000` for LAN mode without encryption
  
### or set TCP/IP host to 192.168.1.1

- `ngrok4com -192.168.1.1` for LAN mode without encryption
- `ngrok4com 192.168.1.1` for LAN mode with encryption
 
It will redirect virtual serial port COM11 on the second computer to the
physical serial port on the first computer over TCP/IP port 7000.<br>

### or set TCP/IP host to 192.168.1.1 and TCP/IP port to 8000

- `ngrok4com -192.168.1.1 8000` for LAN mode without encryption
- `ngrok4com 192.168.1.1 8000` for LAN mode with encryption

It will redirect virtual serial port COM11 on the second computer to the
physical serial port on the first computer over TCP/IP port 8000.<br>

### or use ngrok tunnel created on first computer

- `ngrok4com` for ngrok mode with encryption

It will redirect virtual serial port COM11 on the second computer to the
physical serial port on the first computer over ngrok tunnel.
