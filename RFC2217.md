# RFC 2217 server (TCP to COM port redirector)
--------------------------------------------

You have a server computer with phisical COM7 port and you'd like to share it
through the network by the RFC 2217 "Telnet Com Port Control Option" protocol:

  1. Start the com2tcp-rfc2217.bat on COM7 port. For example:

       `com2tcp-rfc2217.bat COM7 7000`
       or
       `ngrok4com -7` for LAN mode without encryption
       `ngrok4com 7` for ngrok mode with encryption

  It will listen TCP/IP port 7000 for incaming connections and
  redirect them to COM7 port.


# RFC 2217 client (COM port to TCP redirector)
--------------------------------------------

You have a server computer 192.168.1.1 with phisical serial port
shared through the network by the RFC 2217 protocol (see above example) and
you'd like to use it on the client computer like a virtual serial port.

  1. With the com0com's Setup Command Prompt create COM11<->CNCB0 virtual
     COM port pair (see com0com's ReadMe.txt for more info). For example:
       `c:\Program Files (x86)\com0com\setupc.exe`
       `command>install 0 PortName=COM#,RealPortName=COM11,EmuBR=yes,AddRTTO=10,AddRITO=10 -`

  2. Start the com2tcp-rfc2217.bat on CNCB0 port. For example:

       `com2tcp-rfc2217.bat \\.\CNCB0 192.168.1.1 7000`
       or
       `ngrok4com -192.168.1.1` for LAN mode without encryption
       `ngrok4com 192.168.1.1` for LAN mode with encryption
       `ngrok4com` for ngrok mode with encryption

  It will redirect virtual serial port COM11 on the second computer to the
  phisical serial port on the first computer.
