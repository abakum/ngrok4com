# RFC 2217 server (TCP to COM port redirector)
--------------------------------------------

You have a server computer with physical COM7 port and you'd like to share it
through the network by the RFC 2217 "Telnet Com Port Control Option" protocol:

  1. Start the [com2tcp-rfc2217.bat](https://com0com.sourceforge.net/hub4com/ReadMe.txt) on COM7 port. For example:

       `com2tcp-rfc2217.bat COM7 7000`
 ### or set physical serial port to COM7
       `ngrok4com -7` for LAN mode without encryption   
       `ngrok4com 7` for ngrok mode with encryption

  It will listen TCP/IP port 7000 for incaming connections and
  redirect them to COM7 port.<br>

### or select physical serial port
       `ngrok4com -0` for LAN mode without encryption
       `ngrok4com` for ngrok mode with encryption

  It will listen TCP/IP port 7000 for incaming connections and
  redirect them to selected physical serial port.<br>

### or select physical serial port and set TCP/IP port to 8000
       `ngrok4com -0 8000` for LAN mode without encryption
       `ngrok4com 0 8000` for ngrok mode with encryption

  It will listen TCP/IP port 8000 for incaming connections and
  redirect them to selected physical serial port.

# RFC 2217 client (COM port to TCP redirector)
--------------------------------------------

You have a server computer 192.168.1.1 with physical serial port
shared through the network by the RFC 2217 protocol (see above example) and
you'd like to use it on the client computer like a virtual serial port.

  1. With the com0com's Setup Command Prompt create COM11<->CNCB0 virtual
     COM port pair [see com0com's ReadMe.txt for more info](https://com0com.sourceforge.net/com0com/ReadMe.txt). For example:<br>
       `c:\Program Files (x86)\com0com\setupc.exe`<br>
        command>`install 0 PortName=COM#,RealPortName=COM11,EmuBR=yes,AddRTTO=10,AddRITO=10 -`

  3. Start the com2tcp-rfc2217.bat on CNCB0 port. For example:<br>
       `com2tcp-rfc2217.bat \\.\CNCB0 192.168.1.1 7000`
### or set TCP/IP host to 192.168.1.1
       `ngrok4com -192.168.1.1` for LAN mode without encryption
       `ngrok4com 192.168.1.1` for LAN mode with encryption
 
  It will redirect virtual serial port COM11 on the second computer to the
  physical serial port on the first computer over TCP/IP port 7000.<br>

### or set TCP/IP host to 192.168.1.1 and TCP/IP port to 8000
       `ngrok4com -192.168.1.1 8000` for LAN mode without encryption
       `ngrok4com 192.168.1.1 8000` for LAN mode with encryption

  It will redirect virtual serial port COM11 on the second computer to the
  physical serial port on the first computer over TCP/IP port 8000.<br>

### or use ngrok tunnel created on first computer
       `ngrok4com` for ngrok mode with encryption

  It will redirect virtual serial port COM11 on the second computer to the
  physical serial port on the first computer over ngrok tunnel.
